# Variables that apply to all hosts in all environments

# Ansible user for SSH (though we use SSM, Ansible might still reference this)
ansible_user: ubuntu

# HashiCorp Vault configuration (Ansible server needs network access and IAM role for Vault)
# These are the Vault address and a method to get a token.
# For EC2 authentication, the Ansible server's IAM role would be configured in Vault to get a token.
# For a production setup, avoid hardcoding vault_token here; use EC2 auth method + 'auth_method' in lookup.
vault_addr: "https://vault.alasoasiko.co.uk:8200" # !! IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual Vault address !!
# In a robust production setup, you would typically use Vault's EC2 authentication method
# for the Ansible server to retrieve a short-lived token, rather than defining one here.
# For demo/initial setup, if you have a static token, you might use it here.


# Nexus Docker Registry URL - used by all environments
nexus_docker_registry_url: "nexus.alasoasiko.co.uk:8085" # !! IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual Nexus domain and port !!

# Common application name
application_name: "petclinicapps"
